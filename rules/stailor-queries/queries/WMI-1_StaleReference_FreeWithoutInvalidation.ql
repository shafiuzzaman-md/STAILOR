/**
 * @name WMI-1: Stale Reference Creation (Free Without Pointer Invalidation)
 * @description Detects when an object is freed but other structures still hold
 *              pointers to it, creating a dangling/stale reference. This is the
 *              foundation of UAF exploitation chains.
 *
 *              Pattern: Object A is freed, but Object B still has a field pointing
 *              to A. The pointer in B is never set to NULL after A is freed.
 *
 *              In kernel context: e.g., nf_chain->dev pointer not cleared when
 *              net_device is freed, or list_head entries freed without list_del.
 *
 * @kind problem
 * @problem.severity warning
 * @id stailor/wmi-1-stale-reference-creation
